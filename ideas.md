  - login
  - register
- Info/feature

## Playlist

- Global
  - Public or Private (User associated)
- <del> request access </del>
  - <del> User sends request to other user </del>

## Spotipy
### Playing songs

- using spotipy API
- showcasing image

## Recomdations

### Random Selection

- calculate running avg and stdev
- random selection excluding already listened

### Playlist (most likely bad idea)

- playlist of songs with similar values
- Recommending playlists instead
- will have to club playlist before hand

### Artist tags based selection

- save tags user is interested in based on tags from artist of songs they listened to
- select another artist based on the tag recomend thats artists song to them
